# Azure Developer CLI and Container Apps

This is a template repository and you can make your own copy by following the instructions found at: [link](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) 

`Note: This README will be going though a series of changes until the date of the meetup, best would be to take a copy on the day of the meetup.`

- As a part of the meetup we will get our hands dirty with Azure Developer CLI and Azure Container Apps.  We'll hopefully get to cover end-to-end automation using the capabilities vested in us by the tooling at the point of the meetup. (If we're lucky we may get to see more than one scenario)
- In addition we'll get to work with **Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers** and the **3 Musketeers Pattern**.
